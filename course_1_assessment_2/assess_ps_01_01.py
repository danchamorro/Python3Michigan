# There is a function we are providing in for you in this problem called square. It takes one integer and returns the square
# of that integer value. Write code to assign a variable called xyz the value 5*5 (five squared). Use the square function,
# rather than just multiplying with *.


def square(num):
    return num**2


xyz = square(5)
print(xyz)
