# Write code to assign the number of characters in the string rv to a variable num_chars.

rv = """Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
    Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
    While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
    As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
    'Tis some visitor, I muttered, tapping at my chamber door;
    Only this and nothing more."""

# Write your code here!
num_chars = len(rv)
print(num_chars)
