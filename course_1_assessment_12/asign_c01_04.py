# A palindrome is a phrase that, if reversed, would read the exact same. Write code that checks if p_phrase is a
# palindrome by reversing it and then checking if the reversed version is equal to the original. Assign the reversed
# version of p_phrase to the variable r_phrase so that we can check your work.

p_phrase = "was it a car or a cat I saw"

r_phrase = p_phrase[::-1]
