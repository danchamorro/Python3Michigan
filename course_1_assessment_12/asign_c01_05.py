# Provided is a list of data about a storeâ€™s inventory where each item in the list represents the name of an item,
# how much is in stock, and how much it costs. Print out each item in the list with the same formatting, using the
# .format method (not string concatenation). For example, the first print statment should read The store has 12 shoes,
# each for 29.99 USD.
