# Finally, copy in your previous functions and write code that opens the file project_twitter_data.csv which has the fake
# generated twitter data (the text of a tweet, the number of retweets of that tweet, and the number of replies to that tweet).
# Your task is to build a sentiment classifier, which will detect how positive or negative each tweet is. Copy the code from
# the code windows above, and put that in the top of this code window. Now, you will write code to create a csv file called
# resulting_data.csv, which contains the Number of Retweets, Number of Replies, Positive Score (which is how many happy
# words are in the tweet), Negative Score (which is how many angry words are in the tweet), and the Net Score
# (how positive or negative the text is overall) for each tweet. The file should have those headers in that order.
# Remember that there is another component to this project. You will upload the csv file to Excel or Google Sheets and
# produce a graph of the Net Score vs Number of Retweets. Check Coursera for that portion of the assignment, if you‚Äôre
# accessing this textbook from Coursera.
