# Write a program that uses the turtle module and a for loop to draw something. It doesnâ€™t have to be complicated,
# but draw something different than we have done in the past. (Hint: if you are drawing something complicated,
# it could get tedious to watch it draw over and over. Try setting .speed(10) for the turtle to draw fast, or .speed(0) for
# it to draw super fast with no animation.)

import turtle

ws = turtle.Screen()

starTurtle = turtle.Turtle()

for i in range(5):
    starTurtle.forward(100)
    starTurtle.right(144)
