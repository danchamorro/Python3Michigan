# Along with the Pokemon parent class, we have also provided several subclasses. Write another method in the parent class that will be inherited by the subclasses. Call it opponent. It should return which type of pokemon the current type is weak and strong against, as a tuple.

# Grass is weak against Fire and strong against Water

# Ghost is weak against Dark and strong against Psychic

# Fire is weak against Water and strong against Grass

# Flying is weak against Electric and strong against Fighting

# For example, if the p_type of the subclass is 'Grass', .opponent() should return the tuple ('Fire', 'Water')
