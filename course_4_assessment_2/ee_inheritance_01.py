# The class, Pokemon, is provided below and describes a Pokemon and its leveling and evolving characteristics. An instance of the class is one pokemon that you create.

# Grass_Pokemon is a subclass that inherits from Pokemon but changes some aspects, for instance, the boost values are different.

# For the subclass Grass_Pokemon, add another method called action that returns the string "[name of pokemon] knows a lot of different moves!". Create an instance of this class with the name as "Belle". Assign this instance to the variable p1.
