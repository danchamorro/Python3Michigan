# Write code to count the number of strings in list items that have the character w in it. Assign that number to the
# variable acc_num.

# HINT 1: Use the accumulation pattern!

# HINT 2: the in operator checks whether a substring is present in a string.

# Hard-coded answers will receive no credit.
